        <p>I'm Diego Fratta, an incoming PhD student at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I received my undergraduate degeree in Computer Engineering
            and Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. As you can see, this site is pretty mediocre, I will try to keep working on it during
            graduate school.
